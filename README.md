# Online-Shoppers-KNN-Classification

Machine learning mini-project that predicts whether an online shopping session will lead to a purchase using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Includes preprocessing with Pandas and NumPy, feature encoding, scaling, and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.

## Quick start (simple)

Share this project with a friend and tell them to follow these steps (keeps things minimal):

1. Clone the repo:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Abebeana/Online-Shoppers-KNN-Classification.git
cd Online-Shoppers-KNN-Classification
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
. .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If on macOS or Linux, use these commands instead:

```bash
# create venv
python3 -m venv .venv
# activate (macOS / Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required packages:

```powershell
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Open and run the notebook:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
# then open `shopping.ipynb` in the browser and run the cells
```
